# My Web Portfolio

A futuristic, engaging, and interactive panel-based portfolio, designed with glassmorphism and neon-inspired visuals. This project is built for performance and compatibility: it’s purely static, making it perfect for free deployment with GitHub Pages. Mobile users benefit from an accordion layout—no scrolling required!

## 🚀 Features

- **Futuristic, Panel-based Design**: Sections of your portfolio are displayed as interactive panels, offering a memorable and intuitive browsing experience.
- **Accordion Layout for Mobile**: On mobile devices, panels transform into an accordion layout—users tap to expand, with no scrolling necessary.
- **Glassmorphism & Neon Effects**: Striking visual design with transparent glass panels, glowing neon accents, and modern UI elements.
- **Lag-Free, Purely Static**: Built using only HTML, CSS, and lightweight JavaScript—no backend, no frameworks, and no lag, even on modest devices. Fully compatible with GitHub Pages.

## ✨ Usage

1. **Clone or Fork this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/futurisme/My-Web-Portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`** directly in your browser to view the portfolio locally, or edit files as needed.

## 📝 Editing Panels (Your Content)

Panels are defined in the `index.html` file. To edit them:

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite code editor.
2. Each panel is typically a `<section>` or `<div class="panel">` element. Update the text, images, or links as desired.
3. For mobile accordion titles, ensure that each panel has a clearly marked header (e.g., with a class/element like `<h2 class="panel-title">`).
4. Save your changes—done! No compilation or build step is required.

You can also tweak colors, backgrounds, and neon/glassmorphism effects in the `style.css` file to personalize your look.

## 🚢 Deploying with GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository’s Settings.
2. Scroll down to the “Pages” section.
3. Set the source branch to `main` and use `/ (root)` for the folder.
4. Save your changes. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/My-Web-Portfolio/`.
   - Example: https://futurisme.github.io/My-Web-Portfolio/

All features work out of the box—no server or build pipeline needed!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting GitHub → Vercel (Repo Rename/Transfer)

Jika push ke GitHub tidak memicu deploy baru di Vercel, biasanya penyebabnya **bukan kode halaman**, tetapi integrasi Git pada project Vercel yang masih menunjuk repo lama.

Checklist cepat di Vercel:
1. Project terhubung ke repo: `futurisme/My-Web-Portfolio` (bukan owner lama).
2. **Production Branch** = `main`.
3. Root Directory = repository root (`.`).
4. Setelah transfer/rename repo, lakukan reconnect Git Integration di dashboard Vercel.
5. Trigger redeploy manual sekali dari tab Deployments untuk sinkronisasi webhook.

Enjoy your visually stunning, interactive, and mobile-optimized web portfolio.
